  <!--About-->
  <h2>About Mrs. Coulter</h2>

  <p>Mrs. Coulter is an icy and sophisticated villainess who makes her first appearance in the novel Northern Lights, the first book in the His Dark Materials trilogy. Throughout the trilogy, it becomes clear that she doesn't have any meaningful and strong relationships, opting instead for manipulating other people to achieve her own goals even if it kills them. The only exception to this is her very own daughter, Lyra. Mrs. Coulter's soul takes the form of a golden monkey. However, the relationship between them is unlike any other human-daemon relationship in the series. Marisa loathes a part of herself, which is reflected in her abusive treatment of the golden monkey. </p
